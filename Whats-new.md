Hi! Sorry for the compiled js, since there are no major changes, I decided not to delve into the ts code.
What's new:
I added support for running executable files via the hotkey ctrl+alt+k. Also added the ability to run code in the terminal without changing the settings (ctrl+alt+shift+n)
Added a couple of settings, such as ShowAssistedTerminal to show/hide the terminal through which the executable file is launched.
Added the ability to decode the output for each language, the ability to select a standard encoding if there is no configuration for the language,
perhaps some minor changes that I forgot to mention.
