Hi! Sorry for the compiled js, since there are no major changes, I decided not to delve into the ts code.
What's new:
* I added support for running executable files via the hotkey **ctrl+alt+k**. 
* Added the ability to run code in the terminal without changing the settings **ctrl+alt+shift+n**. Hotkey active if code-runner.runinterminal = false (default)
* Added a couple of settings, such as ShowAssistedTerminal to show/hide the terminal through which the executable file is launched.
* Added the ability to decode the output for each language
* Added the ability to select a standard encoding if there is no configuration for the language
* Perhaps some minor changes that I forgot to mention.
